# spectral-normalization-gan

This is the final project of [Deep Learning on Computational Accelerators](https://vistalab-technion.github.io/cs236605/).
> As part of this course, students must complete a small research project instead of a final exam.
> For this project you will either implement a current deep-learning research paper or implement a custom project that relates to your current research topic (subject to approval).
> The idea is to select a paper that seems interesting you, implement it, suggest at least one improvement and evaluate it as well. - TA

## Install
1. Clone this repository and make sure you installed the python3 version of [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ctjoy/spectral-normalization-gan
cd spectral-normalization-gan
```
2. Use conda to create a virtual environment named `sngan`. From the root directory, run
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
3. Activate the new environment by running
```
conda activate sngan
```
Note: If there is any update in the `environment.yml` file. You can use
```
conda env update
```
## Training
```
python main.py [--model] [--loss]
```
- model: dcgan, resnet
- loss: bce, hinge, wasserstein

## Evaluation
Using the [Inception Score](https://github.com/sbarratt/inception-score-pytorch) and [FID Score](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid) according to the paper.
```
python evaluate.py
```

## Main prolem they solved.
they generate examples that are much more diverse than the conventional weight normalization and achieve better or comparative inception scores.

## Why don't use on generator?

## Implementation Details
## The task we complete
- [ ] init value
- [ ] redo the ResNet-like model (with spectral normalization)
- [x] redo the DCGAN-like model (with spectral normalization)
- [x] using CIFAR-10 dataset
- [x] Inception scores
- [x] FID scores
- [x] using STL-10 dataset
- [ ] add GAN hack on the model
- [ ] add spectral normalization on generator because this [paper](https://sthalles.github.io/advanced_gans/)
